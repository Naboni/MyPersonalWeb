                This blog is regarding the current outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) that was first reported from Wuhan, China, on 31 December 2019.
            </p>
            <p>
                Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new strain that was discovered in 2019 and has not been previously identified in humans. 
                Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people.  Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV 
                was transmitted from civet cats to humans and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating 
                in animals that have not yet infected humans. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath 
                and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Standard recommendations to prevent infection spread include regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, 
                thoroughly cooking meat and eggs. Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing.
