                <h2>Eiffel Tower</h2>
                <p>March 12, 2020</p>
                <p>Here brings another blog post of a recent shoot, Iâ€™m so behind in updating my work online so I have a few more shoots to post in the next coming weeks.</p>
                <p>The Eiffel Tower is a famous landmark in Paris. It is the symbol of Paris. It was built between 1887 and 1889, for the 100th year of the French Revolution. 
                    The Eiffel Tower was the entrance arch for a fair called the Exposition Universelle .Also it was named after Alexandre Gustave Eiffel. 
                    The Eiffel Tower is the most visited monument in the world .
                </p>
                <p>It was built by Alexandre Gustave Eiffel. There were 107 bids submitted to construct the Eiffel Tower, 50 people worked on the design, and more than 100 built the parts. 
                    132 workers assembled the parts on site. Construction began on January 28, 1887 and was concluded on March 31, 1889.
                    When the tower was built, it was only meant to be kept for 20 years. People did not like the Eiffel Tower and wanted it taken down. 
                    After the 20 years, the tower became the property of Paris again. By this time, the city had learned that the tower could be used to help with communications. 
                    The military used the tower to communicate during battle. Nobody wanted it to be taken apart.
